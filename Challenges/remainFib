/*
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence that goes as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,....

Your mission today is to calculate the nth non-negative integer that does NOT belong to the Fibonacci sequence.

Since the values can be quite big, both input and output are of type string.

Example

remainFib("1") = "4".

It's clear from the list above the 1st element that does not belong to it is number 4.

remainFib("2") = "6".

The 2nd element not in the sequence is 6.

Input/Output

[time limit] 3000ms (cs)
[input] string number

Constraints:
1 ≤ int(number) ≤ 252.

[output] string

The result as a string.

string remainFib(string number) {
    Int64 num = Int64.Parse(number);
    Int64 n1 = 1;
    Int64 n2 = 2;
    Int64 count = 0;
    while(true){
        if(n2 - n1 - 1 + count >= num)
            break;
        count += n2-n1-1;
        Int64 temp = n2;
        n2 = n1 + n2;
        n1 = temp;
    }
    
    return (n1 + num - count).ToString();
}
