This problem can be solved by pre-school children in 5-10 minutes. By programmers in one hour. By people with a higher educationâ€¦ Well, it certainly can take them a while.

Since you, CodeFighters, are supposed to be programmers, it shouldn't take you that long to solve it :) Take a look at the test cases and figure what this is all about.

Beware the corner cases!

int countIt(int n) {

    do{
        int a = n % 10;
        if(a == 6 || a == 9 || a == 0)
            c++;
        if(a == 8)
            c += 2;
        n /= 10;
    } while(n > 0);
    return c;
