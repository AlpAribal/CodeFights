Given a non-negative number, your task is to write this number in base 2 and calculate the sum of positions of 1s that are followed by 0s counting from right.

Example

For number = 83, the output should be
majorIndex(number) = 7.

8310 = 10100112 which has 1's followed by 0's in positions 2 and 5 (reading from the right), so the answer is 2 + 5 = 7.

Positions of the digits to be found are colored red.

Input/Output

[time limit] 3000ms (cs)
[input] string number

Constraints:
0 â‰¤ int(number) < 253.

[output] integer

int majorIndex(string number) {
    string s = Convert.ToString(Convert.ToInt64(number),2);
    int count = 0; 
    for(int i = s.Length-1; i > 0; i--){
        if(s[i]=='1' && s[i-1] == '0'){
            count += s.Length-i;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
